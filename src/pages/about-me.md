Beyond tech, I’m passionate about photography—especially portrait and aviation photography. It’s a creative outlet that allows me to capture powerful moments and perspectives.

### Hiking 🏔️

I also enjoy hiking and immersing myself in nature. Exploring new trails and landscapes not only refreshes me but also inspires many aspects of my personal and professional life.
